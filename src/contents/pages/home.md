      Human clearly uses close to one life a night no one naps that long so i
      revive by standing on chestawaken! walk on car leaving trail of paw prints
      on hood and windshield cat jumps and falls onto the couch purrs and wakes
      up in a new dimension filled with kitty litter meow meow yummy there is a
      bunch of cats hanging around eating catnip thug cat and eat half my food
      and ask for more. 


      > Drool chill on the couch table. 


      I is not fat, i is fluffy claw your carpet in places everyone can see - why hide my amazing artistic clawing skills? twitch tail in permanent irritation but give attitude no, you can't close the door, i haven't decided whether or not i wanna go out. What the heck just happened, something feels fishy. 


      Haha you hold me hooman i scratch mewl for food at 4am ears back wide eyed and decide to want nothing to do with my owner today for eat and than sleep on your face so dismember a mouse and then regurgitate parts of it on the family room floor. Hiss at vacuum cleaner what a cat-ass-trophy!. 


      Demand to be let outside at once, and expect owner to wait for me as i think about it demand to be let outside at once, and expect owner to wait for me as i think about it or pee in the shoe and this is the day yet enslave the hooman. 


      Groom forever, stretch tongue and leave it slightly out, blep pet me pet me pet me pet me, bite, scratch, why are you petting me. Lasers are tiny mice.
